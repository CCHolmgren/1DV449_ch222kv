Observations: With the cache it takes a lot less time to load the javascript files, but the longpoll.js file takes a lot of time without reason really.

Thing #1:
Fewer requests.
The javascript files can be made into one.
b.jpg, logo.png and clock.png can be made into one.
And while we are at it, script and bootstrap.js is the same, so remove one of them.

Remove b.jpg, it doesn't display. I think that is allowed.

files left:
mess.php
bootstrap.css
scripts.js
logo.png
data:image/png
functions.php

Using CDN:
It will improve when we are talking to several users, when we use cache and so on. But at this time, it doesnt since it would take longer time to load stuff from another site, and there would be another request.
